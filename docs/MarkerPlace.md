## MarkerPlace object specification

google.maps.MarkerPlace object specification

Properties

location

**Type:**  [LatLng](LatLng.md)|[LatLngLiteral](LatLngLiteral.md)

The LatLng of the entity described by this Place. This must be provided for the Place to be considered valid.

placeId

**Type:**  string

The place ID of the place (such as a business or point of interest). The place ID is a unique identifier of a place in the Google Maps database. Note that the placeId is the most accurate way of identifying a place. If possible, you should specify the placeId rather than a placeQuery. A place ID can be retrieved from any request to the Places API, such as a [TextSearch](https://developers.google.com/places/webservice/search). Place IDs can also be retrieved from requests to the Geocoding API.

query

**Type:**  string

A search query describing the place (such as a business or point of interest). An example query would be "Quay, Upper Level, Overseas Passenger Terminal 5 Hickson Road, The Rocks NSW". If possible, you should specify the placeId rather than a placeQuery. The API does not guarantee the accuracy of resolving the query string to a place. If both the placeId and placeQuery are provided, an error is thrown.
