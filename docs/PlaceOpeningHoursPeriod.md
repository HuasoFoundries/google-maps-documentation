PlaceOpeningHoursPeriod interface

google.maps.places.PlaceOpeningHoursPeriod interface

Defines structured information about the opening hours of a Place. **Note:** If a Place is **always open**, the close section will be missing from the response. Clients can rely on always-open being represented as an open period containing day with value 0 and time with value "0000", and no close.
